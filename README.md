# MO-RealEstateParcelsProject

dependencies: os, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, gmap. 

This project will be an open Python Jupyter Notebook achieving mapping of current* vacant land parcels owned throughout Missouri. 
This will include visualized mapping of data in the form of heatmaps utilizing gmap wrapper, etc. 
This notebook will include search bar abilities for user to apply filters and search for specific rows of data and see their results re-populate new plots as well as maps to create a informative and visual experience. 

First steps:
Reading in data 
Target areas of interest 
Visualize trends 

Secondary:
Import more Missouri data and merge to create larger searchable database...merging data from different assesor's office in order to end up with fairly complete Missouri map of vacant lands owned.
the goal in order to grow the database will include figuring areas of interest and identifying areas to merge data on. The goal will be to update the notebook with more data will be as simple as replacing the data. This will require a clear format for how each piece of data enters the notebook.
